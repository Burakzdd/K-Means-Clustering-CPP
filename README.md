# K-Means Clustering Algorithm Implementation in C++

## Description
This project is developed in C++ to cluster data points into groups using the K-Means Clustering Algorithm.

### Overview
This project is designed to cluster a specific dataset into a specified number of clusters (K) using the K-Means algorithm. It is implemented in C++ and utilizes the matplotlibcpp library for visualizing the results.

## File Structure
- Point.h, Point.cpp: Contains the class and functions representing data points.
- Cluster.h, Cluster.cpp: Contains the class and functions used for clustering operations.
- KMeans.h, KMeans.cpp: Contains the class and functions implementing the K-Means algorithm and clustering operations.
- KMeansCluster.h, KMeansCluster.cpp: Contains the class and functions extending the KMeans class and performing visualization operations.
- matplotlibcpp.h: Library used for visualization.
- main.cpp: Main program file. It interacts with the user and executes the K-Means algorithm.
